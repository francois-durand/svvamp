    Even round r (including round 0): the two non-eliminated candidates
    who are ranked first (among the non-eliminated candidates) by least voters
    are selected for the elimination duels that is held in round r+1.
    Odd round r: voters vote for the selected candidate they like most in the
    duel. The candidate with least votes is eliminated.

    Obviously, this method meets the Condorcet criterion.

    Our thanks to Laurent Viennot for the idea of voting system.
