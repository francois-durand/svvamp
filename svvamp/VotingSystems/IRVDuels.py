    """IRV with elimination duels.

    Inherits functions and optional parameters from superclasses
    :class:`~svvamp.ElectionResult` and :class:`~svvamp.Election`.

    :Example:

    >>> import svvamp
    >>> pop = svvamp.PopulationSpheroid(V=100, C=5)
    >>> election = svvamp.IRVDuels(pop)

    Principle: each round, perform a duel between the two least-favorite
    candidates and eliminate the loser of this duel.

    Even round ``r`` (including round 0): the two non-eliminated candidates
    who are ranked first (among the non-eliminated candidates) by least voters
    are selected for the elimination duels that is held in round ``r+1``.

    Odd round ``r``: voters vote for the selected candidate they like most in
    the duel. The candidate with least votes is eliminated.

    This method meets the Condorcet criterion.

    We thank Laurent Viennot for the idea of this voting system.
