class CondorcetSumDefeats(CondorcetSumDefeatsResult, Election):
    """Condorcet with sum of defeats.

    Inherits functions and optional parameters from superclasses
    :class:`~svvamp.ElectionResult` and :class:`~svvamp.Election`.

    :Example:

    >>> import svvamp
    >>> pop = svvamp.PopulationSpheroid(V=100, C=5)
    >>> election = svvamp.CondorcetSumDefeats(pop)

    An *elementary move* consists of reversing a voter's preference about a
    pair of candidate ``(c, d)`` (without demanding that her whole relation of
    preference stays transitive). The score for candidate ``c`` is minus the
    number of *elementary moves* needed so that ``c`` becomes a Condorcet
    winner.

    It is the same principle as Dodgson's method, but without looking
    for a transitive profile.

    In practice:

    .. math::

        \\texttt{scores}[c] = - \\sum_{c \\text{ does not beat } d}\\left(
        \\left\\lfloor\\frac{V}{2}\\right\\rfloor
        + 1 - \\texttt{matrix_duels_rk}[c, d]
        \\right)

    In particular, for :attr:`~svvamp.Population.V` odd:

    .. math::

        \\texttt{scores}[c] = - \\sum_{c \\text{ does not beat } d}\\left(
        \\left\\lceil\\frac{V}{2}\\right\\rceil
        - \\texttt{matrix_duels_rk}[c, d]
        \\right)

    :meth:`~svvamp.Election.CM`: Non-polynomial or non-exact algorithms
    from superclass :class:`~svvamp.Election`.

    :meth:`~svvamp.Election.ICM`: Algorithm from superclass
    :class:`~svvamp.Election`. It is polynomial and has a window of error of 1
    manipulator.

    :meth:`~svvamp.Election.IM`: Non-polynomial
    or non-exact algorithms from superclass :class:`~svvamp.Election`.

    :meth:`~svvamp.Election.not_IIA`: Non-polynomial
    or non-exact algorithms from superclass :class:`~svvamp.Election`.
    If :attr:`~svvamp.Election.IIA_subset_maximum_size` = 2, it runs in
    polynomial time and is exact up to ties (which can occur only if
    :attr:`~svvamp.Population.V` is even).

    :meth:`~svvamp.Election.TM`: Exact in polynomial time.

    :meth:`~svvamp.Election.UM`: Non-polynomial or non-exact algorithms from
    superclass :class:`~svvamp.Election`.
