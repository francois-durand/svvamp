    """Condorcet with sum of defeats.

    Inherits functions and optional parameters from superclasses
    :class:`~svvamp.ElectionResult` and :class:`~svvamp.Election`.

    An *elementary move* consists of reversing a voter's preference about a
    pair of candidate ``(c, d)`` (without demanding that her whole relation of
    preference stays transitive). The score for candidate ``c`` is minus the
    number of *elementary moves* needed so that ``c`` becomes a Condorcet
    winner.

    It is the same principle as Dodgson's method, but without looking
    for a transitive profile.

    In practice:

    .. math::

        scores[c] = - \\sum_{c \\text{ does not beat } d}\\big(
        \\text{floor}(V/2) + 1 - \\texttt{matrix\\_duels\\_vtb}[c, d]
        \\big)

    In particular, for ``V`` odd:

    .. math::

        scores[c] = - \\sum_{c \\text{ does not beat } d}\\big(
        \\text{ceil}(V/2) - \\texttt{matrix\\_duels\\_vtb}[c, d]
        \\big)
