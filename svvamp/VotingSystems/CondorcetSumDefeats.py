    An 'elementary move' is reversing a voter's preference about a pair
    of candidate (c, d) (without demanding that her whole relation of
    preference stays transitive). The score for candidate c is minus the number
    of 'elementary moves' needed so that c becomes a Condorcet winner.

    It is the same principle as Dodgson's method, but without looking
    for a transitive profile.

    In practice:
    scores[c] = - sum_{c does not beat d}{floor(V/2) + 1
                                          - matrix_duels_vtb[c, d]}
    In particular, for V odd:
    scores[c] = - sum_{c does not beat d}{ceil(V/2)
