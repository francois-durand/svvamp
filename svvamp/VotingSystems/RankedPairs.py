    In the matrix of duels, victories (and ties) are sorted by decreasing 
    amplitude. If two duels have the same score, we take first the one where
    the winner has the smallest index; if there is still a choice to make,
    we take first the duel where the loser has the highest index.
    
    Starting with the largest victory, we build a directed graph whose 
    nodes are the candidates and edges are victories. But if a victory
    creates a cycle in the graph, it is not validated and the edge is not
    added.
    
    At the end, we has a transitive connected directed graph, whose adjacency
    relation is included in the relation of victories (with ties broken), 
    matrix_victories_vtb_ctb. The maximal node of this graph (by topological
    order) is declared the winner.
