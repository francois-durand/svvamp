    """Nanson method.

    Inherits functions and optional parameters from superclasses
    :class:`~svvamp.ElectionResult` and :class:`~svvamp.Election`.

    :Example:

    >>> import svvamp
    >>> pop = svvamp.PopulationSpheroid(V=100, C=5)
    >>> election = svvamp.Nanson(pop)

    At each round, all candidates with a Borda score strictly lower than
    average are simultaneously eliminated. When all remaining candidates have
    the same Borda score, it means that the matrix of duels (for this subset
    of candidates) has only ties. Then the candidate with lowest index is
    declared the winner.

    Since a Condorcet winner has always a Borda score higher than average,
    Nanson method meets the Condorcet criterion.

    or non-exact algorithms from superclass :class:`~svvamp.Election`.

    :meth:`~svvamp.Election.IM`: Deciding IM is NP-complete. Non-polynomial
