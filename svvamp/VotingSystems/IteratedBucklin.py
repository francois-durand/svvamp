    """Iterated Bucklin method.

    Inherits functions and optional parameters from superclasses
    :class:`~svvamp.ElectionResult` and :class:`~svvamp.Election`.

    :Example:

    >>> import svvamp
    >>> pop = svvamp.PopulationSpheroid(V=100, C=5)
    >>> election = svvamp.IteratedBucklin(pop)

    The candidate with least *adjusted median Borda score* (cf. below) is
    eliminated. Then the new Borda scores are computed. Etc. Ties are broken
    in favor of lower-index candidates: in case of a tie, the candidate with
    highest index is eliminated.

    Adjusted median Borda score:

        Let ``med_c`` be the median Borda score for candidate ``c``. Let
        ``x_c`` the number of voters who put a lower Borda score to ``c``.
        Then ``c``'s adjusted median is ``med_c - x_c / (V + 1)``.

        If ``med_c > med_d``, then it is also true for the adjusted median.
        If ``med_c = med_d``, then ``c`` has a better adjusted median iff
        ``x_c < x_d``, i.e. if more voters give to ``c`` the Borda score
        ``med_c`` or higher.

        So, the best candidate by adjusted median is the
        :class:`~svvamp.Bucklin` winner. Here, at each round, we eliminate the
        candidate with lowest adjusted median Borda score, which justifies the
        name of "Iterated Bucklin method".

    Unlike Baldwin method (= Iterated Borda), Iterated Bucklin does
    not meet the Condorcet criterion. Indeed, a Condorcet winner may have the
    (strictly) worst median ranking.
