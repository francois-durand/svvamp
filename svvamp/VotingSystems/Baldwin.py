    Inherits functions and optional parameters from superclasses
    :class:`~svvamp.ElectionResult` and :class:`~svvamp.Election`.

    :Example:

    >>> import svvamp
    >>> pop = svvamp.PopulationSpheroid(V=100, C=5)
    >>> election = svvamp.Baldwin(pop)

    Each voter provides a strict order of preference. The candidate with
    lowest Borda score is eliminated. Then the new Borda scores are computed.
    Etc. Ties are broken in favor of lower-index candidates: in case of a tie,
    the candidate with highest index is eliminated.

    Since a Condorcet winner has always a Borda score higher than average,
    Baldwin method meets the Condorcet criterion.

    from superclass :class:`~svvamp.Election`.

    :meth:`~svvamp.Election.ICM`: Exact in polynomial time.
