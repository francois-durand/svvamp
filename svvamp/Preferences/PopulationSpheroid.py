        :param stretching: Number between 0 and ``numpy.inf`` (both included).

        :return: A :class:`~svvamp.Population` object.

        The utility vector of each voter is drawn independently and uniformly
        on a sphere in :math:`\\mathbb{R}^C`. Then, it is sent on the spheroid
        that is the image of the sphere by a dilatation of factor
        ``stretching`` in direction [1, ..., 1]. Cf. working paper Durand et
        al. 'Geometry on the Utility Sphere'.

        The ordinal part of this distribution is the Impartial Culture.

        The parameter ``stretching`` has only influence on voting systems
        based on utilities, especially Approval voting.

            * ``stretching = 0``: pure Von Neumann-Morgenstern utility,
              normalized to :math:`\\sum_c u_v(c) = 0` (spherical model
              with ``C-2`` dimensions).
            * ``stretching = 1``: spherical model with ``C-1`` dimensions.
            * ``stretching = inf``: axial/cylindrical model with only two
              possible values, all-approval [1, ..., 1] and all-reject
              [-1, ..., -1].

        N.B.: This model gives the same probability distribution as a Von
        Mises-Fisher with concentration = 0.
