        :param V: Integer. Number of voters.
        :param C: Integer. Number of candidates.
        :param vmf_concentration: 1d array. Let us note ``k`` its size (number
            of 'groups'). ``vmf_concentration[i]`` is the VMF concentration of
            group ``i``.
        :param vmf_probability: 1d array of size k. ``vmf_probability[i]`` is
            the probability, for a voter, to be in group ``i`` (up to
            normalization). If ``None``, then groups have equal probabilities.
        :param vmf_pole: 2d array of size ``(k, C)``. ``vmf_pole[i, :]`` is the
            pole of the VMF distribution for group ``i``.

        :return: A :class:`~svvamp.Population` object.

        We work on the ``C-2``-sphere: vectors of :math:`\mathbb{R}^C` with
        Euclidean norm equal to 1 and that are orthogonal to
        [1, ...,  1]. It is a representation of the classical Von
        Neumann-Morgenstern utility space. Cf. working paper Durand et al.
        'Geometry on the Utility Sphere'.

        Before all computations, the poles are projected onto the hyperplane
        and normalized. So, the only source of concentration for group ``i`` is
        ``vmf_concentration[i]``, not the norm of ``vmf_pole[i]``. If ``pole``
        is None, then each pole is drawn independently and uniformly on the
        ``C-2``-sphere.

        For each voter ``c``, we draw a group ``i`` at random, according to
        ``vmf_probability`` (normalized beforehand if necessary). Then, ``v``'s
        utility vector is drawn according to a Von Mises-Fisher distribution
        of pole ``vmf_pole[i, :]`` and concentration ``vmf_concentration[i]``,
        using Ulrich's method modified by Wood.

        Once group ``i`` is chosen, then up to a normalization constant, the
        density of probability for a unit vector ``x`` is
        ``exp(vmf_concentration[i] vmf.pole[i, :].x)``,
        where ``vmf.pole[i, :].x`` is a dot product.
