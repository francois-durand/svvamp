        :param V: Integer. Number of voters.
        :param C: Integer. Number of candidates.
        :param stretching: Number between 0 and ``numpy.inf`` (both included).
        :param vmf_concentration: 1d array. Let us note ``k`` its size (number
            of 'groups'). ``vmf_concentration[i]`` is the VMF concentration of
            group ``i``.
        :param vmf_probability: 1d array. ``vmf_probability[i]`` is the
            probability, for a voter, to be in group ``i`` (up to
            normalization). If None, then groups have equal probabilities.
        :param vmf_pole: 2d array of size ``(k, C)``. ``vmf_pole[i, :]`` is the
            pole of the VMF distribution for group ``i``.

        :return: A :class:`~svvamp.Population` object.

        For each voter ``c``, we draw a group ``i`` at random, according to
        ``vmf_probability`` (normalized beforehand if necessary). Then, ``v``'s
        utility vector is drawn according to a Von Mises-Fisher distribution
        of pole ``vmf_pole[i, :]`` and concentration ``vmf_concentration[i]``,
        using Ulrich's method modified by Wood.

        Once group ``i`` is chosen, then up to a normalization constant, the
        density of probability for a unit vector ``x`` is
        ``exp(vmf_concentration[i] vmf.pole[i, :].x)``,
        ``where vmf.pole[i, :].x`` is a dot product.

        Then, ``v``'s utility vector is sent onto the spheroid that is the
        image of the sphere by a dilatation of factor ``stretching`` along the
        direction [1, ..., 1]. For example, if ``stretching = 1``, we stay on
        the unit sphere of :math:`\\mathbb{R}^C`. Cf. working paper Durand et
        al. 'Geometry on the Utility Sphere'.

        N.B.: if ``stretching != 1``, it amounts to move the poles. For
        example, if the pole [1, 0, 0, 0] is given and ``stretching = 0``,
        then the actual pole will be [0.75, - 0.25, - 0.25, - 0.25]
        (up to a multiplicative constant).

        poles are normalized before being used. So, the only source of
        concentration for group ``i`` is ``vmf_concentration[i]``, not the
        norm of ``vmf_pole[i]``. If ``vmf_pole`` is ``None``, then each pole
        is drawn independently and uniformly on the sphere.
