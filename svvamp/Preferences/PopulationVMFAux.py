def population_vmf_aux(C, V, concentration, pole=None):
    """Von Mises-Fisher distribution

    Arguments:
    C -- Integer. Number of candidates.
    V -- Integer. Number of voters.
    concentration -- Number >= 0. Concentration of the VMF distribution.
    pole -- 1d array of size C. Center of the VMF distribution.

    Returns:
    preferences_utilities -- 2d array of size (V, C). Preferences of the
        population.

    Each row (voter) of preferences_utilities is drawn according to a Von
    Mises-Fisher law, using Ulrich's method modified by Wood. We work on the
    'C-1'-sphere (in R^C).

    Up to a normalization constant, the density of probability for a unit
    vector x is exp(concentration pole.x), where pole.x is the dot product
    of pole and x.

    pole is normalized before being used. So, the only source of
    concentration is the argument 'concentration', not the norm of 'pole'. If
    pole is not given, it is drawn at random on the sphere (uniformly),
    then the algorithm is launched (all voters are drawn with the same pole).
