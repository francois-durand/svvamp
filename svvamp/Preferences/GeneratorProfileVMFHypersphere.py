    """Profile generator using the Von Mises-Fisher distribution on the ``n_c - 1``-sphere

    :param n_v: Integer. Number of voters.
    :param n_c: Integer. Number of candidates.
    :param stretching: Number between 0 and ``numpy.inf`` (both included).
    :param vmf_concentration: 1d array. Denote ``k`` its size (number of 'groups'). ``vmf_concentration[i]`` is
        the VMF concentration of group ``i``.
    :param vmf_probability: 1d array of size ``k``. ``vmf_probability[i]`` is the probability, for a voter,
        to be in group ``i`` (up to normalization). If ``None``, then the groups have equal probabilities.
    :param vmf_pole: 2d array of size ``(k, n_c)``. ``vmf_pole[i, :]`` is the pole of the VMF distribution for group
        ``i``.

    For each voter ``c``, we draw a group ``i`` at random, according to ``vmf_probability`` (normalized beforehand if
    necessary). Then, ``v``'s utility vector is drawn according to a Von Mises-Fisher distribution of pole
    ``vmf_pole[i, :]`` and concentration ``vmf_concentration[i]``, using Ulrich's method modified by Wood.

    Once group ``i`` is chosen, then up to a normalization constant, the density of probability for a unit vector
    ``x`` is ``exp(vmf_concentration[i] vmf.pole[i, :].x)``, ``where vmf.pole[i, :].x`` is a dot product.

    Then, ``v``'s utility vector is sent onto the spheroid that is the image of the sphere by a dilatation of factor
    ``stretching`` along the direction [1, ..., 1]. For example, if ``stretching = 1``, we stay on the unit sphere of
    :math:`\\mathbb{R}^n_c`. Cf. Durand et al. 'Geometry on the Utility Sphere'.

    N.B.: if ``stretching != 1``, it amounts to move the poles. For example, if the pole [1, 0, 0, 0] is given and
    ``stretching = 0``, then the actual pole will be [0.75, - 0.25, - 0.25, - 0.25] (up to a multiplicative constant).

    poles are normalized before being used. So, the only source of concentration for group ``i`` is
    ``vmf_concentration[i]``, not the norm of ``vmf_pole[i]``. If ``vmf_pole`` is ``None``, then each pole is drawn
    independently and uniformly on the sphere.
