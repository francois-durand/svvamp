    Notes
    -----
    At each round, all candidates with a Borda score strictly lower than average are simultaneously eliminated. When
    all remaining candidates have the same Borda score, it means that the matrix of duels (for this subset of
    candidates) has only ties. Then the candidate with lowest index is declared the winner. Since a Condorcet winner
    has always a Borda score higher than average, Nanson method meets the Condorcet criterion.
