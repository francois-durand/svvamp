    Notes
    -----
    At counting round ``r``, all voters who rank candidate ``c`` in ``r``\ :sup:`th` position gives her an additional
    vote. As soon as at least one candidate has more than :attr:`n_v`/2 votes (accrued with previous rounds),
    the candidate with most votes is declared the winner. In case of a tie, the candidate with lowest index wins.
