    Each voter provides a strict order of preference. The candidate with lowest Borda score is eliminated. Then the
    new Borda scores are computed. Etc. Ties are broken in favor of lower-index candidates: in case of a tie,
    the candidate with highest index is eliminated.

    Since a Condorcet winner has always a Borda score higher than average, Baldwin method meets the Condorcet
    criterion.
