    An *elementary move* consists of reversing a voter's preference about a pair of candidate ``(c, d)`` (without
    demanding that her whole relation of preference stays transitive). The score for candidate ``c`` is minus the
    number of *elementary moves* needed so that ``c`` becomes a Condorcet winner. It is the same principle as
    Dodgson's method, but without looking for a transitive profile.

    In practice:

    .. math::

        \\texttt{scores}[c] = - \\sum_{c \\text{ does not beat } d}\\left(
        \\left\\lfloor\\frac{V}{2}\\right\\rfloor + 1 - \\texttt{matrix_duels_rk}[c, d]
        \\right)

    In particular, for :attr:`n_v` odd:

    .. math::

        \\texttt{scores}[c] = - \\sum_{c \\text{ does not beat } d}\\left(
        \\left\\lceil\\frac{V}{2}\\right\\rceil - \\texttt{matrix_duels_rk}[c, d]
        \\right)

    * :meth:`is_cm_`: Non-polynomial or non-exact algorithms from superclass :class:`Rule`.
    * :meth:`is_icm_`: Algorithm from superclass :class:`Rule`. It is polynomial and has a window of error of 1
      manipulator.
    * :meth:`is_im_`: Non-polynomial or non-exact algorithms from superclass :class:`Rule`.
    * :meth:`is_iia_`: Non-polynomial or non-exact algorithms from superclass :class:`Rule`. If
      :attr:`iia_subset_maximum_size` = 2, it runs in polynomial time and is exact up to ties (which can occur only if
      :attr:`n_v` is even).
    * :meth:`is_tm_`: Exact in polynomial time.
    * :meth:`is_um_`: Non-polynomial or non-exact algorithms from superclass :class:`Rule`.
