class GeneratorProfileSpheroid(GeneratorProfile):
    """Profile generator using the 'Spheroid' model.

    Parameters
    ----------
    n_v : int
        Number of voters.
    n_c : int
        Number of candidates.
    stretching : number
        Number between 0 and ``numpy.inf`` (both included).
    sort_voters : bool
        This argument is passed to :class:`Profile`.

    Notes
    -----
    The utility vector of each voter is drawn independently and uniformly on a sphere in :math:`\\mathbb{R}^n_c`. Then,
    it is sent on the spheroid that is the image of the sphere by a dilatation of factor ``stretching`` in direction
    [1, ..., 1]. Cf. Durand et al., 'Geometry on the Utility Sphere'.

    The ordinal part of this distribution is the Impartial Culture.

    The parameter ``stretching`` has an influence only on voting systems based on utilities, especially Approval
    voting.

        * ``stretching = 0``: pure Von Neumann-Morgenstern utility, normalized to :math:`\\sum_c u_v(c) = 0` (
          spherical model with ``n_c-2`` dimensions).
        * ``stretching = 1``: spherical model with ``n_c-1`` dimensions.
        * ``stretching = inf``: axial/cylindrical model with only two possible values, all-approval [1, ...,
          1] and all-reject [-1, ..., -1].

    N.B.: This model gives is equivalent to a Von Mises-Fisher model with concentration = 0.

    Examples
    --------
    Typical usage:

        >>> generator = GeneratorProfileSpheroid(n_v=10, n_c=3, stretching=1)
        >>> profile = generator()
        >>> profile.preferences_rk.shape
        (10, 3)

    With some stretching:

        >>> generator = GeneratorProfileSpheroid(n_v=10, n_c=3, stretching=2)
        >>> profile = generator()
        >>> profile.preferences_rk.shape
        (10, 3)

        >>> generator = GeneratorProfileSpheroid(n_v=10, n_c=3, stretching=.5)
        >>> profile = generator()
        >>> profile.preferences_rk.shape
        (10, 3)
