class GeneratorProfileLadder(GeneratorProfile):
    """Profile generator using the 'Ladder' model.

    Parameters
    ----------
    n_v : int
        Number of voters.
    n_c : int
        Number of candidates.
    n_rungs : int
        Number of rungs of the ladder.
    sort_voters : bool
        This argument is passed to :class:`Profile`.

    Notes
    -----
    Each utility ``preferences_ut[v, c]`` is drawn independently and uniformly between ``n_rungs`` values that
    divide the interval [-1, 1] equally. For example, if ``n_rungs = 21``, then values in {-1, -0.9, ..., 1} are used.

    The ordinal part of this distribution is **not** the Impartial Culture. Indeed, weak orders of preference come
    with non-zero probability. This model is interesting the study the effect of voters' ties.

    Examples
    --------
        >>> generator = GeneratorProfileLadder(n_v=10, n_c=3, n_rungs=5)
        >>> profile = generator()
        >>> profile.preferences_rk.shape
