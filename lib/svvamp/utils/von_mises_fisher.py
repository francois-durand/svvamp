def profile_vmf_aux(n_c, n_v, concentration, pole=None):
    """Von Mises-Fisher distribution.

    Parameters
    ----------
    n_c : int
        Number of candidates.
    n_v : int
        Number of voters.
    concentration : number
        Number >= 0. Concentration of the VMF distribution.
    pole : list or ndarray
        1d array of size ``n_c``. Center of the VMF distribution.

    Returns
    -------
    ndarray
        2d array of size (``n_v``, ``n_c``). Preferences (utilities) of the population.

    Notes
    -----
    Each row (voter) of ``preferences_ut`` is drawn according to a Von Mises-Fisher law, using Ulrich's method modified
    by Wood. We work on the ``n_c - 1``-sphere (in ``R^n_c``). Up to a normalization constant, the density of
    probability for a unit vector ``x`` is ``exp(concentration pole.x)``, where ``pole.x`` is the dot product of
    ``pole`` and ``x``.

    ``pole`` is normalized before being used. So, the only source of concentration is the argument ``concentration``,
    not the norm of ``pole``. If ``pole`` is not given, it is drawn at random on the sphere (uniformly), then the
    algorithm is launched (i.e. all voters are drawn with the same pole).

    Examples
    --------
    Typical usage:

        >>> preferences_ut = profile_vmf_aux(n_v=10, n_c=3, concentration=5, pole=[1, 0, 0])
        >>> preferences_ut.shape
        (10, 3)

    If the pole is not given, it is drawn at random:

        >>> preferences_ut = profile_vmf_aux(n_v=10, n_c=3, concentration=5)
        >>> preferences_ut.shape
        (10, 3)

    With a concentration of 0, it amounts to the uniform model:

        >>> preferences_ut = profile_vmf_aux(n_v=10, n_c=3, concentration=0, pole=[1, 0, 0])
        >>> preferences_ut.shape
        (10, 3)

    With an infinite concentration, all voters are on the pole:

        >>> profile_vmf_aux(n_v=5, n_c=3, concentration=np.inf, pole=[1, 0, 0])
        array([[1, 0, 0],
               [1, 0, 0],
               [1, 0, 0],
               [1, 0, 0],
               [1, 0, 0]])
